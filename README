To compile hrktorrent you need:
a) boost
b) asio header files
c) libtorrent (the one by rasterbar: http://www.rasterbar.com/products/libtorrent/index.html)

on Debian and systems derived from Debian, like Ubuntu, the required packages can be installed by running
  $ sudo apt-get install build-essential libtorrent-rasterbar-dev libboost-filesystem-dev


To use a config file, put it in your $HOME/.hrktorrent dir and name it "hrktorrent.rc", there is an example included.
NOTE: Commandline switches override configuration file settings.

For IP-Filtering, make sure it is enabled and copy the ipfilter.dat file to ~/.hrktorrent/ipfilter.dat

Help is available by just running hrktorrent.
